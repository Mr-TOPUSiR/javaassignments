Q. "Java is a platform independent language", justify this statement.

Ans: As java is a high level programming language, the source code must be compiled into 
machine understandable form. In java, compilers convert the program into byte code.
The bytecode generated by java only needs JVM (which is a part of Java Runtime Environment
and converts bytecode to machine level) to run the java programs. 
Thus, the java doesnot depend on any platform i.e Operating System, it only needs Java Runtime Environment independent of the platform it is running on.
